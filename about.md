## About me

I'm Harshith Keni, a software developer, foodie and gamer that
lives in Sioux Falls, SD. I currently work with [carsforsale.com](https://www.carsforsale.com)
as a full-stack developer/programming grunt. I'm a transplant
from India and ended up in South Dakota because I chose to get a Master's in
Computer Science from
[South Dakota State University](https://www.sdstate.edu/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science).

I'm a polyglot programmer with a bit of web development experience. I am still
trying to find my niche of specialization and I tend to bounce around a lot
trying to figure things out.

I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to make this blog with the
[Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/) theme.
